abstract = {In biomedical data, the imbalanced data problem occurs frequently and causes poor prediction performance for minority classes. It is because the trained classifiers are mostly derived from the majority class. In this paper, we describe an ensemble learning method combined with active example selection to resolve the imbalanced data problem. Our method consists of three key components: 1) an active example selection algorithm to choose informative examples for training the classifier, 2) an ensemble learning method to combine variations of classifiers derived by active example selection, and 3) an incremental learning scheme to speed up the iterative training procedure for active example selection. We evaluate the method on six real-world imbalanced data sets in biomedical domains, showing that the proposed method outperforms both the random under sampling and the ensemble with under sampling methods. Compared to other approaches to solving the imbalanced data problem, our method excels by 0.03-0.15 points in AUC measure.},

abstract = {Genetic programming evolves Lisp-like programs rather$\backslash$nthan fixed size linear strings. This representational$\backslash$npower combined with generality makes genetic$\backslash$nprogramming an interesting tool for automatic$\backslash$nprogramming and machine learning. One weakness is the$\backslash$nenormous time required for evolving complex programs.$\backslash$nIn this paper we present a method for accelerating$\backslash$nevolution speed of genetic programming by active$\backslash$nselection of fitness cases during the run. In contrast$\backslash$nto conventional genetic programming in which all the$\backslash$ngiven training data are used repeatedly, the presented$\backslash$nmethod evolves programs using only a subset of given$\backslash$ndata chosen incrementally at each generation. This$\backslash$nmethod is applied to the evolution of collective$\backslash$nbehaviors for multiple robotic agents. Experimental$\backslash$nevidence supports that evolving programs on an$\backslash$nincrementally selected subset of fitness cases can$\backslash$nsignificantly reduce the fitness evaluation time$\backslash$nwithout sacrificing generalization accuracy of the$\backslash$nevolved programs.},
